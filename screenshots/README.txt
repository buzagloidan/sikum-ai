How to add your screenshots:

1. Take screenshots of your bot in action, showing:
   - Quiz generation process
   - Quiz questions and answer selection
   - Quiz results

2. Save your screenshots with these filenames:
   - quiz-generation.png
   - quiz-questions.png
   - quiz-results.png

3. Add the image files to this directory

4. Push the changes to GitHub

Your screenshots will then appear in the README.md file.

Alternatively, if you have your images hosted elsewhere (like Imgur or another image hosting service), you can update the README.md file with the direct URLs to your images.
